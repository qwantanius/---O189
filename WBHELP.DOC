STARTING C-- WORK BENCH
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
First ensure that all files included with C-- are in the same directory as
the Work Bench Program (WB.COM and WB.EXE).  Then set the environment
variable 'C--' to the path in which the work bench files are located.

For example, if your files are located in the directory 'C:\C--' then type
the following line at the DOS prompt:

          SET C--=C:\C--

You may wish to add the command to your AUTOEXEC.BAT.

After the variable has been set, simply type WB at the DOS prompt.  It is
also possible to specify a file or files to load into the editor at start
up.  Just WB followed by the files you wish to be loaded, WILD CARD
CHARACTERS CAN BE USED (don't you just love it!). 

For example, to load all the *.C-- files in the current directory into the
SPHINX C-- Work Bench, type:

           WB *.C--

If an extension is not given, .C-- will be assumed.


USING C-- WORK BENCH
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Most features of the C-- Work Bench are reasonably straight forward.
Two features, set run file and set compile file may need some explanation.

SET PRIMARY RUN FILE
    Pressing <CTRL><F8> will open a window allowing you to change the 
primary run file.  The primary run file is the filename of the program
that is run when the Compile&Run or the Just Run option is selected.  If
compile&run has been selected, the compile file is compiled and the run file
is executed.  The run file may be different than the run file, this allows
for development of programs that required a driver or loader program to be
run to execute the compiled file.
    If the primary run filename is left blank, the primary compile filename
will be used.

SET PRIMARY COMPILE FILE
    Pressing <SHIFT><F8> will open a window allowing you to change the 
primary compile file.  The primary compile file is the filename of the 
source file to be compiled.
    If the primary compile filename is left blank, the filename of the 
current window will be used as the source file.


NOTES ON COMPILING
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The C-- Work Bench spawns the C-- compiler, which is actually a command line
compiler.  The compiler then compiles the given file.  The compiler only
compiles the file off disk, therefore all changes must be saved to disk to 
be recognized by the compiler.  So save your source file before selecting
<F5> to compile&run or <SHIFT><F5> to compile.

Pressing <F4> will display the output screen.  This may be used to view
output from the compiler, such as error messages. 


EMERGENCY KILL KEYS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Even the best programmers sometimes make mistakes, and the dreadful lock-up
occurs, usually in some non-terminating loop that does not allow <CTRL><C>
to kill it.  Well the work bench has a built in kill key combo that will
terminate the current program that is executing.

Pressing <CTRL><ALT><C> will terminate the current program running.  When
these keys are pressed, a serious attempt will be made to kill off the
current program running.  No care will be given to what state the program
is in.  This does impose the possiblities of severly crashing your machine,
but at this point your probably desperate to kill the program anyway, so its
worth a shot.  Be careful, <CTRL><ALT><C> will also terminate the C--
compiler or the C-- Work Bench if they are the currently executing program.
